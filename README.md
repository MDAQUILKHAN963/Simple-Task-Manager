#Simple Task Manager

The Simple Task Manager is a web-based application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently.
It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks,
and provides a visual interface to track tasks across three stages: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
it includes features like drag-and-drop functionality, voice input, dark mode, task prioritization, and due dates. 
Tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring they persist even after the page is refreshed or closed.
